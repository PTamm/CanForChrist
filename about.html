            <p>
                Many of the forefathers of this great Nation knew the importance of building a country 
                upon the principles of the Bible, and they acknowledged God as the Supreme Ruler over 
                government and each individual life. The first verse of our national anthem includes the prayer, 
                “God keep our land glorious and free!” The little-known fourth verse reminds us all that only through God 
                can we enjoy true peace, protection and hope of eternal life.

                Much has changed since our Nation was founded. Canada has moved farther and farther away from the God of the Bible 
                and the Christian principles which helped shape our country. With this shift, we have seen a decline in morality, 
                marriage, family values and national harmony. These were once common place.

                We, a group of concerned Canadian citizens from across this country, realize the need for our Nation to return to a 
                right worship of God and recognize the imperative of repentance and faith in Jesus Christ. We wish for you and your 
                family to have your own personal copy of this essential portion of God’s Word, the Holy Bible, so we are distributing 
                copies of the books of John and Romans to towns and cities across Canada. This specially marked self-study edition will 
                guide you through verses from the Bible showing God’s plan for saving mankind from the penalty of their sin.

                In this booklet you will learn of God’s love for you and the forgiveness He offers. The books of John and Romans have 
                been selected because of the message they emphasize: the gospel of John is a historical account of the things Jesus did 
                and taught; Romans emphasizes the way of salvation and how you can experience freedom from sin through faith in Jesus Christ. 
                It is our prayer that you will receive Jesus Christ as your Saviour.
